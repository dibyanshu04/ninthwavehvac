                        Ultrasonic flow measurement is among the best & most accurate technology available these days. It is widely accepted &
                        prominently used across the industries due to its non-cohesive nature with the flow media. It is also non-effected in
                        high magnetic field zones, where other technologies like electromagnetic & Boltzmann’s turbine technologies might have a
                        challenge.
                        <br>
                        Our Shenitech ultrasonic flow meters work on Transit time principle which ensures high accuracy. Our ultrasonic flow
                        meters are used not only for domestic
                        <br>
                        water application but also in dirty water having high TDS, in Sewerage treatment & effluent treatment application.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Transit time principle is annotated as below.</strong>
                        <br>
                        “ <i>It is the time difference taken by two UH frequency pulses to reach the diametrically opposite ends of the pipe, which
                        is related to the velocity of the fluid media inside pipe in direct proportion</i> ”
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Suppose ‘T1’ is the time taken by pulse to travel downstream to the flow of media & ‘T2’ is the time take by the pulse
                        to travel upstream of the flow media moving unidirectional with velocity ‘v’ , then time difference ‘δT’ is related to
                        velocity as
                        <br>
                        <strong>
                            (T2 – T1) = δT <span class="text-primary">Or</span> δT α v Or δT = k * v <span class="text-primary">Or</span> δT/k = v
                        </strong>
                        <br>
                        Cross section area of pipe is ‘A’
                        Then Flow rate ‘Q’ can be calculated as
                        <br>
                        <h2  style="text-align: center;">
                        <span class="border rounded rounded">&nbsp;Q=v*A&nbsp; </span>
                        </h2>
                        We can offer inline type as well as clamp-on and insertion type sensors, depending upon the applications’ requirement.
                        Our flow meters offer all standard signal outputs like analog outputs (4- 20 mA or 0-10 VDC), Modbus over RS-485, M-Bus
                        etc. which is widely accepted for third party integration.

                        The STUF 300R ultrasonic thermal energy meter provides abundant capabilities for accurate thermal energy measurement of
                        a liquid-based thermal energy production / transferring system. It is the 3rd generation energy meter from Shenitech.
                        Compared to its predecessors, the 3rd generation offers better performance and a richer feature set, all at a lower
                        price.
                        <br>
                        The STUF 300R system is consisted of a high performance ultrasonic flowmeter EF10 and a pair of standard PT100
                        temperature sensors. The ultrasonic flowmeter is based on our cutting-edge clamp-on flow measurement technology, which is capable of measuring the flow from outside of a pipe accurately and reliably. Due to the non-intrusive nature of this technology, there is no pipe cutting, no moving parts, no pressure drop, no leaks and
                        no risk of contamination. Besides, the installation is simple and requires no special skills or tools.
                        <br>
                        The two PT100 sensors, which could be either insertion type or surface-mounting type, are used to measure the
                        temperature of the supply flow and the return flow. The energy consumption rate is then calculated based on the
                        temperature difference and the measured flowrate. A built-in energy totalizer is used to accumulate the amount of energy
                        delivered.
                        <br>
                        STUF 300R provides versatile input/output interfaces, such as isolated digital outputs, relay output, batch control,
                        alarm, 4-20mA output. In addition, the built-in isolated RS-485 port with surge protection and MODBUS support makes
                        remote energy monitoring and energy meter networking easy and reliable. Other output modules, such as BACnet module,
                        Ethernet module, GSM/GPRS wireless module, RF module and more, can be added to the standard package.
                        <br>
                        STUF 300R is an ideal choice for improving HVAC, energy production and building energy efficiency in terms of heating,
                        cooling ventilation and air-conditioning.

                        <strong>Conclusions:</strong>
                        <br>
                        The entire installation and system tuning was completed within two days time, therefore a quick andeconomical
                        installation. This is only possible with non-intrusive clamp-on ultrasonic technology. The fact that the size of the
                        pipe was as large as 24 , one can only imagine how expensive and labor intensive it would have been to use another type
                        of technology, i.e., mechanical flowmeter or magnetic flowmeter. STUF 300R BTU meter resulted with saving the customer
                        major installation costs and quickly delivered most favorable results.

                    <p>
                    <b>Variable Air Volume (VAV) Boxes</b> are required to control air supply as per the requirement in an air distribution network
                    of air flow in a particular zone. VAV Boxes are used very frequently in office space, commercial towers, conference
                    rooms & control area to control temperature & try to achieve a particular set point given to its thermostat.
                    <br>
                    <strong>VAV Boxes</strong> by varying airflow can control various parameters like temperature, CO2 level, positive differential pressure,
                    depending upon its application. It also attains substantial energy saving by blocking access air into the duct & hence
                    in-turn low rpms of AHU fans, unlike constant air volume system which is not capable of achieving high energy
                    efficiency.

                    VAV controller comes with BACNet® MS/TP communication standard, which     
                    is widely accepted for third party integration across the country. We also provide tested integrators for VAV
                    integration.
                    <br>
                    In past years we have successfully commissioned VAV system at so many prestigious multi-national client offices across
                    the country, catering to their customized requirements.
                    <br>
                    Applications successfully commissioned are briefed below.
                    <br>
                    <b>Zone Temperature Application</b>
                    This is the most common type of application, required to control temperature by varying air flow. The most critical of
                    them were heating & cooling application, where air temperature changes as per the weather condition, & hence VAV
                    operation also reversed to achieve a set point. Our technical team has mastered these applications to ensure proper
                    operation of the system.
                    <br>
                    <b>Fresh Air/ Ventilation (Demand Control Ventilation) Application</b>
                    In Demand Control Ventilation, a VAV operates to limit & measure the air flow required to maintain a CO2 differential
                    level in a particular zone. A high CO2 level can cause lower work efficiency of the work force. Also access fresh air
                    intake in an AHU can decrease its energy efficiency. In order to control an optimum level of CO2 differential level, a
                    Variable Air Volume Box finds its application, it measures CO2 level & modulate accordingly to maintain a CO2 level
                    inside a work space. We have commissioned systems having such requirement across the country successfully.
                    <br>
                    Our controllers are fully compatible to maintain VOC level, rH level etc. to provide a controlled environment.
                    <br>
                    <b>Differential Pressure Application</b>
                    <br>
                    We have also come across differential pressure application, where a VAV is placed in return duct, & it allows
                    maintaining a higher pressure in the controlled area. This application is generally used in controlled environment like
                    clean room, drug formulation chambers, storage cabins, Server rooms etc. Applying VAV system, an efficient dust free
                    system can be provided by maintaining a positive pressure inside the zone.
                    <br>
                    We have undertaken these critical application & successfully commissioned them.

                    <b>Application:</b>
                    <br>
                    The hydronic balance is a significant requirement for the efficient operation of a hydronic heating or cooling
                    installation. In an unbalanced system under or over
                    provision of hot water to individual radiators or circuits can occur. Apart from the correct selection of radiator

                    required by national standards.

                    The Valve is a variable orifice double-regulating balancing valve for the return with additional functions shutoff,
                    draining and filling.
                    <br>
                    It can be upgraded to an automatic balancing valve - even after the system has been taken into commission and under
                    system pressure.

                    The PRV valve protects domestic, commercial and industrial applications against excessive water supply pressure. It
                    reduces both water consumption and noise from water hammer, while minimising over pressure damage. The set outlet
                    pressure can be maintained even when there are wide inlet pressure fluctuations. A drop tight seal means outlet water
                    pressure will not increase when there is no flow. It has been awarded the Waterwise Marque.
