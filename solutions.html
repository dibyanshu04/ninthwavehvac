                        <br>
                        BTU Meter or Heat Meters are used to measure the heat consumption of an Air Handler Unit in commercial
                        buildings,
                        Hotels, IT Parks & Malls etc. Heat Metering is a way to generate a legitimate bills based on the cooling
                        consumption of
                        a tenant. The other billing methods based on PSFT (per square feet), is generally getting obsolete, as the
                        consumption
                        of Air Handler Unit varies depending upon the heat load variation.

                        BTU billing is critical as it is complex to understand that what to bill, & how to bill. But under Ninth
                        wave’s expert
                        supervision, it has become easier for a biller or building owner to understand the technicality related to
                        Heat Metering
                        billing. Heat Metering system once installed makes everyday life of a maintenance engineer easy, as by
                        looking a single
                        screen, he will be able to find out where exactly is problem & can plan service activities accordingly.

                        It also
                        checks current status of a meter & can find out if meter is having any technical issues. It shows the
                        current
                        consumption values of every individual meter, like flow (m3/hr), Supply water temperature (oC), Return water

                        By deducing the data from billing pattern & chilled water consumption, it becomes easier for an engineer to
                        plan
                        maintenance activities & also can achieve higher savings in electricity bills, by running Chillers in a more

                        treatment of
                        water. We also do customization as per the customer’s requirement, like <span class="text-warning">automation of chemical dosing to
                        maintain pH,
                        conductivity, Hardness in water, audio-visual alarm system for water quality & start-stop a process</span> in case
                        water
                        quality is not upto the mark.
                        <br>
                        Polluted water is a gigantic threat to the environment as it can pollute water tables & hence can cause
                        several diseases
                        to the society. Waste water should be treated before being sent out of a plant to city severs, or used for
                        gardening or
                        cultivation as per the pollution control board guidelines. It is hence a social responsibility & imperative
                        to treat
                        waste water & have a record of water parameters, which is generally demanded & checked by Environmental
                        bodies time to
                        time. A monitoring system needs to be in place, so that the complete water treatment plant can be controlled
                        from a
                        single place.
                        <br>
                        We can provide complete package solution for waste water treatment right from different sensors like <span class="text-warning">pH,
                        Conductivity,
                        Chlorine, TDS, Turbidity, BOD & COD analyzers</span> etc. to control panels & software to monitor graphically the
                        quality of
                        water.</p>

                    <p>Basement Car parking is a need of hour, due to exponential increase in number of vehicles in recent years.
                        Today, every
                        building whether residential or commercial requires a multilevel basement parking, where a large number of
                        vehicles can
                        be parked. Parking levels are vast open area covered from all side & hence there is <span class="text-warning">a chance of high CO
                        level & in turn
                        low Oxygen level.</span>
                        <br>
                        Carbon mono Oxide is a poisonous gas & inhalation of this gas in large quantity can damage brain cells or
                        even death due
                        to lack of oxygen in body. Thus every car parking needs a ventilation system, designed as per the guidelines
                        mentioned
                        in <span class="text-success">National Building Code of India.</span> This ventilation system has large exhaust & fresh air jet fans which
                        generally run
                        on constant speed all through & hence maintain a desired level of oxygen inside a car parking.
                        <br>
                        The power consumed by this system is an overhead & can be minimized by proper automation of system, by
                        maintaining CO
                        level within limit.<span class="text-warning">The tolerable concentration of CO in a basement is upto 30 ppm</span> . By Automatizing
                        ventilation system
                        the high cost of running ventilation fans can be curtailed as well as we can monitor CO level in various
                        part of car
                        parks.

                        help
                        customer in selecting proper sensors with range & design the system as per their requirement. We give
                        automation panels,
                        with visual display of CO levels with sequencing of exhaust fans & manual fan start-stop function for fans.
                        These panels
                        are communicable type & can be integrated with Fire & Alarm system as well as Building management system.
